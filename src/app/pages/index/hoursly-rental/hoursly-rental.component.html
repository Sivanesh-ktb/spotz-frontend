Any defined terms used but not defined in this Hourly Booking Agreement shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Terms of Use.<br /> <br /> If you use the Service on behalf of an Organization, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to bind such Organization to this Hourly Booking Agreement and to act on behalf of such Organization with respect to any actions you take in connection with the Service. You agree to respond promptly and completely to requests from Spotz for additional information that Spotz deems necessary to determine your authority to act on behalf of an Organization.

<h2>License</h2>

<h2>Payment</h2> 
<p>The Guest agrees to the Total Fees and other pricing terms applicable to your use of the Service as specified in these Terms of Use and as otherwise communicated to you through the Service. All fees and charges paid by Users in connection with the Service are non-refundable, except as expressly stated in the Terms of Use or Space Booking Agreement.</p>
<p>The Total Fees will be displayed to a Member before the Member sends a Booking Request to a Host.&nbsp; After a Member creates a Booking Request, a Host is required to either confirm or reject the request within the Booking Request Period; otherwise, the Booking Request will be automatically cancelled. &nbsp;If a requested booking is rejected or not confirmed by the Host any amounts collected by Spotz will be refunded to such Member, and any pre-authorization of such Member&rsquo;s credit card will be released, if applicable.</p>

<p>In order for a Guest to establish a Booking Request pending the applicable Host&rsquo;s confirmation, you understand and agree that Spotz, on behalf of the Host, reserve the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum to verify your credit card. You agree to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Spotz or its third-party payment processor(s).&nbsp; You agree to make payments by one of the methods described in the Service, e.g. by PayPal or credit card.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a general rule, Spotz will collect the Total Fees due once your Booking Request is confirmed. Please note that Spotz cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Guest by his or her bank related to Spotz&rsquo;s collection of the Total Fees, and Spotz disclaims all liability in this regard.&nbsp; Once your Booking is completed you will receive an email summarizing your confirmed booking.</p>
<p>In lieu of collecting a deposit, Guest permits Spotz to collect payment for any damages up to $250 caused by Guest or Participant during their Event.</p>

In these cases it is permitted to arrange the insurance outside of the Service.&nbsp; Not all sports and activities are eligible for the Event Insurance Policy, allowed sports are listed in the policy terms document.&nbsp; Event Insurance Policy terms can be found at <a href="../../insurance">findspotz.io/insurance</a>.</p>
